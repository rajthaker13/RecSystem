# RecSystem

Team Project on Recommendation Systems for Users on the NeuroFlow Platform 

## Testing Procedure:
1. Run video_watched_events csv through "create_patient_info_csv.ipynb" file to generate patient_info.csv
2. Plug patient_info.csv into "samplerec.py" file (replace value on line FIXME )

We are trying to answer the quesitons:
1. What are the major themes from the video list?
2. What videos are most watched by our users?
